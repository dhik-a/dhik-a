Rumah123 is a market-leading property portal in Indonesia with at least 300K active users. Our goal is to connect property agents and real estate developers with potential buyers/renters in various big cities in Indonesia. I was part of the special team assigned to rebuild the Rumah123 App using Flutter and responsible for the app's continuous improvement since.

Property portal for ordinary home-owners who want to sell their house and people who seek secondary properties. Subsidiary of Singapore-based 99.co, adjusted to fit with Indonesia's market. Still under the same management, 99.co Indonesia is designed to fill the niche that is not yet reached by Rumah123.

PT Bank SUMUT (Sumatera Utara) is a local bank from North Sumatra, Indonesia. As a government-owned local bank, Bank SUMUT has been used by all civil servants working in North Sumatra for financial transactions including payroll and cash transfer/withdrawal. With so many users, our goal was to build a banking app that can make it easier for less tech-savvy people to use digital services provided by Bank SUMUT. And so this app was born and evolved over time from native app to using cross-platform framework like Flutter as we continuously strive to quickly adapt its usability based on our core users' feedbacks.

Payment with QRIS (Quick Response Indonesian Standard) is one of the most popular payment method in Indonesia. PT Bank NTB Syariah as one of the government-owned local banks from the province of Nusa Tenggara Barat hoped to provide its users--specifically, owners of small business--an opportunity to implement QRIS payment as enhancement for their business. For that reason, we explored the possibilities of an app that is capable of facilitating QRIS-based transactions.
