Rumah123 is a market-leading property portal in Indonesia with at least 300K active users. Our goal is to connect property agents and homeowners with potential buyers/renters in various big cities in Indonesia. I was part of the special team assigned to rebuild the Rumah123 App using Flutter and responsible for the app's continuous improvement since.

### SUMUT Mobile

PT Bank SUMUT (Sumatera Utara) is a local bank from North Sumatra, Indonesia. As a government-owned local bank, Bank SUMUT has been used by all civil servants working in North Sumatra for financial transactions including payroll. With so many users, our goal was to build a banking app that can make it easier for less tech-savvy people to use various services provided by Bank SUMUT. I was responsible for maintaining the i SUMUT Mobile app using Swift, and then later migrating the codebase to Flutter.
